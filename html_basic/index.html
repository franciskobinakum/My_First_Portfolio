  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

  <p>This is my first portfolio project built using only HTML. It marks the beginning of my journey into front-end development.</p>

  <h2>About This Project</h2>

  <p>The goal of this project is to learn the basics of HTML structure, semantic tags, and web page layout without using frameworks.</p>

  <h3>My Learning Experience</h3>

  <p>Building this page helps me understand how to organize content properly and structure a clean webpage.</p>

  <p>As I grow as a developer, I plan to improve this project with CSS, JavaScript, and more professional UI designs.</p>
